1. First check if nodeGraph tree is properly made
-> Graph node is added but references is not proplery set.
-> Now it is registering references
-> Level and parentlist is not proplery set ffs.
-> Becuase I was not adding newly created child node into the map
-> Also I didn't updated existing targetNode's refernces to updated.

2. Second check if order is getting sorted properly
-> Checked

3. Thirdly check if complex nodeGraph can be made
-> Currently childrenLIst is strange and childrenList is treated as Array... what? 
-> I was setting referecnes directly and didn't find out because I was search only this.variableName
-> What a stupid mistake

4. Check if status is proplery updated
-> Not currently set
-> Reasoning is because level is not set properly 
	-> This is becuase not newly created node is not setting children's level as something other than original.
	-> To fix this and proplery address duplicate level, 
	-> In case targetNode is not newly created and there is at least one existing node, recurisvely increase targetNode's ancestor's level by 1.
	-> + If newly created child exists then set children's level as targetNode's level + 1 after the recurisve incrementation.
	-> + It should check mutual references or it would cause infinite loop and crash, or if not worse cause stack overflow exception.
	-> CHECK ::: Ok, this looks ok for now.

-> Dependency check should care about both timestamp and file status

5. Implement prevention of mutual references
-> Done with depdencies checking

6. Check if mutual references prevention is proplery executed.
-> Done, actually it is just throwing error for now, for ergonomics catch properly.

### Another note

0. Make ergonomic procedure and button interaction for dependencies check.
	-> Dependency check should be done when all files are saved (wihout unsaved tabs). => Done
	-> Currently dependencies check doesn't save to files fix this. -> Done

1. Implement file watch feature.
	-> Should work as reload whole sysroot files => Done
	-> Display Current status of opened tab as somewhat like (deleted or renamed?) => Done with simple asterisk
	-> Reloading should affect existing tabs -> Done

20201104 ------ DONE

### IMPORTANT!!!
### Keep in mind this milestone
-> Reading sysroot calls should check dependencies before user interaction. or shouldn't?

2 Make comments for all functions and variables
-> Done

3 Add aesthetics => Partially done -> There is no such 'done' in graphic design... which sucks
	-> Make sidenav always visible and move all buttons inside of navMenu
	-> Make status bar and tab buttons go with current toastuieditor (or find what toastuieditor has used. There must be a referecnes).

4. Enable drag and drop for references + Able to input reference by hand
    -> Show references to upper part of editor.
	-> Only add to temporary content apply when save button is clicked.
	=> Somewhat satisfied going to lext step

4.5 Maybe depdencies checker glitch exists... check why no children document is set as outdated. => Done
	-> This should be set as updated.
	-> was because I was sorting as if it was a number 

5. Ergonoic boost
	-> Display references inside of status bars => Done
		-> Show which reference document is outdated. => Done
	-> Display close button next to tab menu => Done
	-> Display root directory on top of side menu => Done
	-> Change direcotory naming when toggleing => Done
	-> Show basic direction(like click the open directory button to start the jobs text is displayed on startup screen) => Done
	-> Make help text on hover icon buttons. => Done... but somewhat not perfect.

5. Notify which file is in mutual references error and make mutual refernce exception visible to end users.
	=> Done

6. Make accelerator(Shortcut key of electron) work with button actions => Done  => Acutally somewhat wrong
	(kinda confusing at first time, but remote made a thing like a breeze.)
	=> I set globalshorcut not local shortcut.
	=> Not done really!!

7. Export to pdf option.  => F* this shit... priting ti pdf is much lightweight and even dpi high... wth??

7.7 Print button => Partial Done
	-> However it will markdown in markdown mode => Just made it to switch to wysiwyg mode.

#. Make config file 

#. Maybe add markdown file support for temporary file before saving into gdml file

#. Custom markdown css rules? => Not necessary but would be fun to use yet hard to implement.

#. Maybe open recent directory.
