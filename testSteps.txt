1. First check if nodeGraph tree is properly made
-> Graph node is added but references is not proplery set.
-> Now it is registering references
-> Level and parentlist is not proplery set ffs.
-> Becuase I was not adding newly created child node into the map
-> Also I didn't updated existing targetNode's refernces to updated.

2. Second check if order is getting sorted properly
-> Checked

3. Thirdly check if complex nodeGraph can be made
-> Currently childrenLIst is strange and childrenList is treated as Array... what? 
-> I was setting referecnes directly and didn't find out because I was search only this.variableName
-> What a stupid mistake

4. Check if status is proplery updated
-> Not currently set
-> Reasoning is because level is not set properly 
	-> This is becuase not newly created node is not setting children's level as something other than original.
	-> To fix this and proplery address duplicate level, 
	-> In case targetNode is not newly created and there is at least one existing node, recurisvely increase targetNode's ancestor's level by 1.
	-> + If newly created child exists then set children's level as targetNode's level + 1 after the recurisve incrementation.
	-> + It should check mutual references or it would cause infinite loop and crash, or if not worse cause stack overflow exception.
	-> CHECK ::: Ok, this looks ok for now.

-> Dependency check should care about both timestamp and file status

5. Implement prevention of mutual references
-> Done with depdencies checking

6. Check if mutual references prevention is proplery executed.
-> Done, actually it is just throwing error for now, for ergonomics catch properly.

### Another note

0. Make ergonomic procedure and button interaction for dependencies check.
	-> Dependency check should be done when all files are saved (wihout unsaved tabs). => Done
	-> Currently dependencies check doesn't save to files fix this. -> Done

1. Implement file watch feature.
	-> Should work as reload whole sysroot files => Done
	-> Display Current status of opened tab as somewhat like (deleted or renamed?) => Done with simple asterisk
	-> Reloading should affect existing tabs -> Done

20201104 ------ DONE

### IMPORTANT!!!
### Keep in mind this milestone
-> Reading sysroot calls should check dependencies before user interaction. or shouldn't?

!2 Make comments for all functions and variables
-> Done

!3 Add aesthetics => Partially done -> There is no such 'done' in graphic design... which sucks
	-> Make sidenav always visible and move all buttons inside of navMenu
	-> Make status bar and tab buttons go with current toastuieditor (or find what toastuieditor has used. There must be a referecnes).

XXX Able to input reference by hand => This should be done with full Path which is just too trivial trash it.

!Important
	-> Refernce check is broken
	-> Rechecking changes status which is not acceptible.
	-> ANd this error happens 
	index.js:149 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'status' of undefined
    at HTMLButtonElement.<anonymous> (index.js:149)
	-> I think this derived from gdmlList got doubled after chaning files.

!4. Enable drag and drop for references 
	-> Currently dependencies checking is not properly done yet.
	-> After chaning content of the file and manualy saving 
	-> Dependency checking yield error saying undefined object do not have status
	-> After a inspection it says totalGdmlList is doubled in which reason I don't know
	-> I thought totalGdmlList was not resetting on setting root direcotory which was partially
	-> right but... after dependencies checking it add gdmlList by one hmm...
	-> And it has gone... F* this magic show... 


    -> Show references to upper part of editor. => Done
	-> Make refDiv consistant over tabs => Done
	-> Only add to temporary content apply when save button is clicked. => Done
	-> Check if saving is really working.
		-> DEBUGGIN 
		-> Changed content is applied to file.
		-> Save button doesn't change tab text => Just made to change it 
		-> Reloading button does it's job

		-> Next step 
		-> Check if exterior change is detected both for content and references

		-> DEBUGGIN
		-> changed inside of editor and changed outside
		-> Manual save activated
		-> Saved and error ocurred
			-> Which was just typo
		-> However after that. 
		-> hello_world2.gdml list button still redirects to hello_world3 tab not 2
			-> 2 changed to 3 thus 2 list should go to 2 tab
				->  This was because I set highlight color stupid... Quit it already ffs  
			-> 2 tab is shown as unsaved for no reason?
				-> Unsaved was due to br tag which is quite mysterious
		-> Newly modified document's ref tag's close button doesn't work it spits delte(refValue) is not a function.
		-> Because refs have beceom array? WTF? It should be a set
		-> Ok it was set from elsewhere LIke i don't shit... I just changed it
		-> With both content and reference change after save it still didn't make saved status
			-> Because I was not setting refStatus
		-> Made status change after showSaveDialog has not canceled it was not ok to preset status although comment said so.

!4.5 Maybe depdencies checker glitch exists... check why no children document is set as outdated. => Done
	-> This should be set as updated.
	-> was because I was sorting as if it was a number 

!5. Ergonoic boost
	-> Display references inside of status bars => Done
		-> Show which reference document is outdated. => Done
	-> Display close button next to tab menu => Done
	-> Display root directory on top of side menu => Done
	-> Change direcotory naming when toggleing => Done
	-> Show basic direction(like click the open directory button to start the jobs text is displayed on startup screen) => Done
	-> Make help text on hover icon buttons. => Done... but somewhat not perfect.

!5. Notify which file is in mutual references error and make mutual refernce exception visible to end users.
	=> Done

!6. Make accelerator(Shortcut key of electron) work with button actions => Done  => Acutally somewhat wrong
	(kinda confusing at first time, but remote made a thing like a breeze.)
	=> I set globalshorcut not local shortcut.
	=> Not done really!!

X7. Export to pdf option.  => F* this shit... priting ti pdf is much lightweight and even dpi high... wth??

!7.7 Print button => Partial Done
	-> However it will markdown in markdown mode => Just made it to switch to wysiwyg mode.

8. Make new document button.

8.5 Find a way to make toastuieditor's shortcut doesn't collid with electron's shortcut

#. Make config file 

#. Maybe add markdown file support for temporary file before saving into gdml file

#. Custom markdown css rules? => Not necessary but would be fun to use yet hard to implement.

#. Maybe open recent directory.

#. Check if manual save mechanism is alright
	-> Because if manual save is activated then it will not be deactivated until saving.
