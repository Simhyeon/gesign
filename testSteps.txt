1. First check if nodeGraph tree is properly made
-> Graph node is added but references is not proplery set.
-> Now it is registering references
-> Level and parentlist is not proplery set ffs.
-> Becuase I was not adding newly created child node into the map
-> Also I didn't updated existing targetNode's refernces to updated.

2. Second check if order is getting sorted properly
-> Checked

3. Thirdly check if complex nodeGraph can be made
-> Currently childrenLIst is strange and childrenList is treated as Array... what? 
-> I was setting referecnes directly and didn't find out because I was search only this.variableName
-> What a stupid mistake

4. Check if status is proplery updated
-> Not currently set
-> Reasoning is because level is not set properly 
	-> This is becuase not newly created node is not setting children's level as something other than original.
	-> To fix this and proplery address duplicate level, 
	-> In case targetNode is not newly created and there is at least one existing node, recurisvely increase targetNode's ancestor's level by 1.
	-> + If newly created child exists then set children's level as targetNode's level + 1 after the recurisve incrementation.
	-> + It should check mutual references or it would cause infinite loop and crash, or if not worse cause stack overflow exception.
	-> CHECK ::: Ok, this looks ok for now.

-> Dependency check should care about both timestamp and file status

5. Implement prevention of mutual references
-> Done with depdencies checking

6. Check if mutual references prevention is proplery executed.
-> Done, actually it is just throwing error for now, for ergonomics catch properly.

### Another note

0. Make ergonomic procedure and button interaction for dependencies check.
	-> Dependency check should be done when all files are saved (wihout unsaved tabs). => Done
	-> Currently dependencies check doesn't save to files fix this. -> Done

1. Implement file watch feature.
	-> Should work as reload whole sysroot files => Done
	-> Display Current status of opened tab as somewhat like (deleted or renamed?) => Done with simple asterisk
	-> Reloading should affect existing tabs -> Done

20201104 ------ DONE

### IMPORTANT!!!
### Keep in mind this milestone
-> Reading sysroot calls should check dependencies before user interaction. or shouldn't?

2 Make comments for all functions and variables
-> Done

3 Add aesthetics
	-> Make sidenav always visible and move all buttons inside of navMenu
	-> Make status bar and tab buttons go with current toastuieditor (or find what toastuieditor has used. There must be a referecnes).

4. Enable drag and drop for references -> There is no such done in graphic design... which sucks
    -> Show references to upper part of editor.
	-> Only add to temporary content apply when save button is clicked.
	=> Somewhat satisfied going to lext step

5. Ergonoic boost
	-> Display references inside of status bars
		-> Show which reference document is outdated.
	-> Display close button next to tab menu => Done
	-> Display root directory on top of side menu => Done
	-> Change direcotory naming when toggleing => Done
	-> Show basic direction(like click the open directory button to start the jobs text is displayed on startup screen) => Done
	-> Make help text on hover icon buttons. => Done... but somewhat not perfect.

5. Notify which file is in mutual references error and make mutual refernce exception visible to end users.

6. Make accelerator(Shortcut key of electron) work with button actions

7. Export to pdf option.

#. Make config file 

#. Maybe add markdown file support for temporary file before saving into gdml file
