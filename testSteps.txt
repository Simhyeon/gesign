1. First check if nodeGraph tree is properly made
-> Graph node is added but references is not proplery set.
-> Now it is registering references
-> Level and parentlist is not proplery set ffs.
-> Becuase I was not adding newly created child node into the map
-> Also I didn't updated existing targetNode's refernces to updated.

2. Second check if order is getting sorted properly
-> Checked

3. Thirdly check if complex nodeGraph can be made
-> Currently childrenLIst is strange and childrenList is treated as Array... what? 
-> I was setting referecnes directly and didn't find out because I was search only this.variableName
-> What a stupid mistake

4. Check if status is proplery updated
-> Not currently set
-> Reasoning is because level is not set properly 
	-> This is becuase not newly created node is not setting children's level as something other than original.
	-> To fix this and proplery address duplicate level, 
	-> In case targetNode is not newly created and there is at least one existing node, recurisvely increase targetNode's ancestor's level by 1.
	-> + If newly created child exists then set children's level as targetNode's level + 1 after the recurisve incrementation.
	-> + It should check mutual references or it would cause infinite loop and crash, or if not worse cause stack overflow exception.
	-> CHECK ::: Ok, this looks ok for now.

-> Dependency check should care about both timestamp and file status

5. Implement prevention of mutual references

6. Check if mutual references prevention is proplery executed.

### Another note

0. Make ergonomic procedure and button interaction for dependencies check.
	-> Dependency check should be done when all files are saved (wihout unsaved tabs).
	-> Reading sysroot calls dependencies check before user interaction.

1. Implement file watch feature.
	-> Should work as reload whole sysroot files
	-> Display Current status of opened tab as somewhat like (deleted or renamed?)
